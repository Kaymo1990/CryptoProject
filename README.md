# CryptoProject
Full project, coming soon...

This project uses live data via the Coingecko API to get pricing data and analyse it using technical analysis such as looking at 100d volatility and moving averages.
This data is returned to the user in an easy to understand statement with what the data means from an unbiased perspective.
